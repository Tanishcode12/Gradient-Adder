# Gradient-Adder
Gradient Adder is a lightweight browser-based image tool built with vanilla JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas API. It lets users load images, select colors, and apply customizable linear or radial gradients in real time. The app preserves image detail, supports transparent PNG export, and runs fully client-side with no external libraries or backend.
